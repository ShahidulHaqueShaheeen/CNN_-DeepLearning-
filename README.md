# CNN (Deep Learning) Projects

This repository contains multiple projects and resources focused on **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**, demonstrating the power of deep learning for image classification and other tasks.

## Overview
- Includes a **Cat vs Dog Classification Project**, showcasing the use of CNNs for binary image classification.
- Implements the **LeNet-5 Architecture**, a pioneering CNN model for handwritten digit recognition.
- Explores key CNN concepts such as **Padding**, **Pooling**, and **Stride** to enhance feature extraction and performance.
- Utilizes frameworks like **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for building, training, and evaluating CNN models.
